# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

npx hardhat verify --network lisk-sepolia 0x96771377a3463Ff3724b1cD63b7B67F659D234bc "0xf1bEAAb3D518994d74248f01b862E9E01534d91D"
